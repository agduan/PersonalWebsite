I have been trying very hard to like poetry for a long time, without success. So many Mary Olivers and Mary Oliver ripoffs have gone in and out of my brain that I am now effectively immune to being told to love life. Still, here are my favorites:
<a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/42539/killing-floor">Ai, Killing Floor</a>
<a href="https://genius.com/Richard-siken-birds-hover-the-trampled-field-annotated">Richard Siken, Birds Hover the Trampled Field</a>
<a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/55860/imperial-city">Richie Hofmann, Imperial City</a>
