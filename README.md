# Personal Website

## Overview
This is my [personal website](https://alexandraduan.wiki), a simple, minimalist theme featuring a sidebar, a theme toggle (light/dark), and content pages, including a responsive 2-column portfolio page with an image carousel. Made with HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and Google Fonts.

## Setup & Usage
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
3. Modify content and styles in `style.css` and HTML files as needed.
4. Images and icons are stored in the `images/` folder, and portfolio images are stored in `images/design/'. Replace with your own assets as needed.

## Themes
Toggle between the light and dark themes using the sun/moon icon in the upper-right-hand corner.
